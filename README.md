## Project Overview

In an age where digital advertising plays a pivotal role in reaching and engaging with target audiences, understanding the effectiveness of Facebook ad campaigns is of paramount importance. This project utilizes a rich dataset containing detailed information on various ad campaigns, including audience demographics, reach, impressions, and financial metrics.

## Data Overview

The [dataset](data/Data.xlsx) used in this project contains 18 columns, including Campaign ID, Campaign Name, Audience, Age, Geography, and a range of Facebook metrics such as Reach, Impressions, Clicks, and Revenue. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of how each ad campaign performed. More info about is [here.](data/data_info.txt)

## Goals of Facebook Ads

Our primary objectives in analyzing these Facebook ad campaigns are as follows:

- **Grow Social Media Audience** : Determine which campaigns were most successful in increasing the social media audience.

- **Generate More Website Visitors** : Identify campaigns that led to higher click-through rates and unique link clicks, driving more website traffic.

- **Brand Awareness**: Measure the impact of ad campaigns on brand awareness using metrics like Impressions and Reach.

## Target Selection

Targets for these ad campaigns were carefully chosen based on specific geography and age ranges. Understanding how these factors affect campaign performance is a key focus of our analysis.

## Facebook Metrics

To evaluate ad campaign performance, we consider a range of Facebook metrics, including:

- **Impressions** : The number of times the ad was viewed.
- **Frequency** : How often the ad was shown to a single user on average.
- **Reach** : The number of unique users who viewed the ad.
- **Unique Click Links (Result)** : The number of unique users who clicked on ad links, indicating engagement.

## Conclusion

In our analysis, we calculated an average rank for each campaign based on these metrics. ***Campaigns with the highest ranks are to be eliminated***. Notably, **Campaigns 3 and 10** both received the **highest** rank of **9.2**, leading to their elimination as they outperformed other campaigns significantly.

We encourage you to explore the project's findings, visualizations, and insights. Your contributions, feedback, and suggestions are highly valued. Together, we aim to enhance our understanding of Facebook ad campaign performance and improve advertising strategies.
